French Crown Jewels Stolen
==========================

On 19 October 2025, thieves disguised as workers stole eight pieces of the [French Crown Jewels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Crown_Jewels "French Crown Jewels") from the [Galerie d'Apollon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerie_d%27Apollon "Galerie d'Apollon") of the [Louvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre "Louvre") in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), France. The robbery took less than ten minutes and happened during regular opening hours.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-adamsonap-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-2) It was the first [art theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_theft "Art theft") from the Louvre since the 1998 theft of the painting [_Le chemin de Sèvres_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_chemin_de_S%C3%A8vres "Le chemin de Sèvres").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-4)

Background
----------

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2025_Louvre_robbery&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

The 16th-century [Galerie d'Apollon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerie_d%27Apollon "Galerie d'Apollon") within the Louvre displayed what remained of the [French Crown Jewels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Crown_Jewels#Regalia_and_jewels_at_the_Louvre "French Crown Jewels"), including the [Crown of Louis XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Louis_XV_of_France "Crown of Louis XV of France") and the [Hortensia diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortensia_diamond "Hortensia diamond").[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-5)

The first documented theft from the Louvre occurred in 1911, when [Vincenzo Peruggia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Peruggia "Vincenzo Peruggia"), a former employee of the museum, stole the [_Mona Lisa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa "Mona Lisa") (it was recovered two years later in Italy).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-6) In 1998, the [_Le chemin de Sèvres_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_chemin_de_S%C3%A8vres "Le chemin de Sèvres") painting by Camille Corot was stolen and has not yet been found. At the time, Louvre's museum director, [Pierre Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Rosenberg "Pierre Rosenberg") warned that the museum's security was "fragile".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-france24-7) Another Louvre director, [Laurence des Cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_des_Cars "Laurence des Cars"), asked the Paris police to conduct a security audit of the museum. Although recommendations were made after the audit, they were only beginning to be implemented at the time of the 2025 robbery.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-france24-7) According to labour unions, Louvre's security had been undermined by staff reductions, while museum attendance has soared. The [SUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_syndicale_Solidaires "Union syndicale Solidaires") union issued a statement on 19 October 2025, complaining of "the destruction of security jobs" at the Louvre.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-france24-7)

In January 2025, French President [Emmanuel Macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron") announced plans for a renovation and expansion of the Louvre. The planned renovation and expansion was a result of the increasing number of visitors each year to the Louvre.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-8) On 16 June 2025, the museum's employees went on strike in protest against chronic issues such as overcrowding, understaffing and "untenable" working conditions.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-10)

In the 2020s, other French museums were also targeted and had items stolen, including the [Adrien Dubouche Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_national_Adrien-Dubouch%C3%A9 "Musée national Adrien-Dubouché") in September 2025 and the [Cognacq-Jay Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_Cognacq-Jay "Musée Cognacq-Jay") and the [Hiéron Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hi%C3%A9ron_Museum&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hiéron Museum (page does not exist)") \[[fr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_du_Hi%C3%A9ron "fr:Musée du Hiéron")\], both in November 2024.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-BBC-know-11)

A "monte-meuble", similar to the one used in the robbery

The robbery occurred at about 9:30 a.m. [CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time "Central European Time"), 30 minutes after the museum opened to visitors.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Reuters-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Cambriolage_au_Louvre-2025-13) The thieves arrived at the building and entered from the [Seine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine "Seine") side, bringing tools. The burglars were wearing [yellow and orange vests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-visibility_clothing "High-visibility clothing") to disguise themselves as workers.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Cambriolage_au_Louvre-2025-13) Two members of the crew,[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14) with their faces concealed with [balaclavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaclava_\(clothing\) "Balaclava (clothing)"),[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Reuters-12) gained entry to a second-floor balcony of the building's south side using a [_monte-meuble_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monte-meuble#French "wikt:monte-meuble"), a vehicle-mounted electric [hoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoist_\(device\) "Hoist (device)") commonly used in Paris to move furniture in or out of a building via an upper-story window.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14)

Once they gained access using the hoist's platform,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-adamsonap-1) they used a [disc cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_cutter "Disc cutter")[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Cambriolage_au_Louvre-2025-13) to cut through a glass window to access the _Galerie d'Apollon_, triggering security alarms.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14) After threatening the guards with their power tools, the thieves took nine pieces from two glass display cases,[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-BBC-know-11)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Vandoorne-15) then left the museum by descending the hoist's ladder to two other members of the crew,[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14) who were waiting on [motor scooters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_\(motorcycle\) "Scooter (motorcycle)").[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-16) During their exit, they dropped the [Crown of Empress Eugénie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Empress_Eug%C3%A9nie "Crown of Empress Eugénie") in the street, reducing their haul to eight items.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-17) They attempted to set fire to the basket of the vehicle-mounted lift before fleeing, but a museum staffer prevented them from doing so.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14) The thieves fled along the banks of the [Seine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine "Seine") to the [Boulevard Périphérique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_P%C3%A9riph%C3%A9rique "Boulevard Périphérique") and then took the [A6 autoroute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A6_autoroute "A6 autoroute") southwards.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-19) The entire theft took no more than seven minutes.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Vandoorne-15)

The museum was evacuated and closed for the rest of the day.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-20)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-21) Following the robbery, the Louvre remained closed on the following Monday, 20 October,[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-22) with a notice on its website stating: "The Musée du Louvre will remain closed today for exceptional reasons. All reservations for today's date will be reimbursed. We apologise for the inconvenience."[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Euronewsweek20251020-23)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-24)

Items stolen

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2025_Louvre_robbery&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Items stolen")\]

The Paris prosecuter's office estimated the value of the stolen items as [€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro")88 million.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-25) The items were identified by the [Ministry of Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_\(France\) "Ministry of Culture (France)") as:

*   The reliquary brooch, a large corsage bow brooch, and the tiara of [Eugénie de Montijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A9nie_de_Montijo "Eugénie de Montijo").[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-27)
    

The collection's most famous item, the [Regent Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent_Diamond "Regent Diamond"), valued at over US$60 million,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Reuters-12) was left in place. While fleeing, the robbers dropped the [Crown of Empress Eugénie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Empress_Eug%C3%A9nie "Crown of Empress Eugénie"), which was found damaged, though the extent of the damage has not been revealed. The Paris prosecutor's office said that a second jewelled item had also been dropped but did not say what it was.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14)

Investigation
-------------

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2025_Louvre_robbery&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Investigation")\]

The Paris prosecutor's office opened an investigation into the incident,[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14) with prosecutor [Laure Beccuau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laure_Beccuau "Laure Beccuau") saying that 60 people had been assigned to the investigation.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-28) Police reviewed [CCTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV "CCTV") footage along the escape route.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-BBC-know-11) Photographs showed a small truck parked next to the museum with a ladder stretched out to a first floor balcony.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-29) [_Le Parisien_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien "Le Parisien") reported that the police recovered two [angle grinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_grinder "Angle grinder"), a [blowtorch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowtorch "Blowtorch"), gasoline, gloves, a [walkie-talkie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkie-talkie "Walkie-talkie"), a blanket and a crown at the scene.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-Vandoorne-15)

Reactions
---------

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2025_Louvre_robbery&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Reactions")\]

President [Emmanuel Macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron") condemned the robbery, saying:

> The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history. We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice. Everything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this, under the leadership of the Paris prosecutor's office. The Louvre New Renaissance project, which we launched in January, provides for strengthened security. It will be the guarantor of the preservation and protection of what constitutes our memory and our culture.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-30)

Interior Minister [Laurent Nuñez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Nu%C3%B1ez "Laurent Nuñez") called it a "major robbery" and that the value of the stolen goods was "incalculable".[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-31)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-adamsonap-1) Culture Minister [Rachida Dati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachida_Dati "Rachida Dati") told [TF1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF1 "TF1"): "We saw some footage: they don't target people, they enter calmly in four minutes, smash display cases, take their loot, and leave. No violence, very professional."[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-News.Az-32)

Justice Minister [Gérald Darmanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rald_Darmanin "Gérald Darmanin") reflected on the image that the robbery projected onto France, saying "People were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels and give France a terrible image."[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-33)

Political opponents have used the heist to harshly criticise the current government, including [Éric Ciotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ric_Ciotti "Éric Ciotti"), who described the heist as an "Ultimate symbol of its \[the current government's\] collapse and failure." He also claimed that allowing such an event to take place is "a threat to the entire Nation". Communist politicians have criticised the government's meager reaction to numerous recent strikes.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Louvre_robbery#cite_note-PorterBreeden-14)
